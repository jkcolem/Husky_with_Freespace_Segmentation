# How to run things on L40 nodes.
 This document explains how to run NVIDIA Isaac ROS packages on Palmetto Cluster. At the moment (April 2024) this document was written, the best way to go about this is to be on Windows machine with MobaXterm. The process to install MobaXterm and how to SSH into Palmetto Cluster can be [here.](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/palmetto/connect/ssh/). It is expected that you are either using eduroam or connected to the clemson network via VPN.


## Prerequisites
To run Nvidia Isaac ROS packages on L40 in a custom Isaac Sim environment, you need to-

    1. Setup a token to access Clemson's Nucleus server
    2. Create a workspace for Isaac ROS packages in "Omnidev" directory

### Setting up Omnitoken
To setup the token to Clemson University's Nucleus server, follow [this](https://clemson.sharepoint.com/:v:/r/teams/MATHWORKSAUTONOMY/Shared%20Documents/Husky%20ISAAC%20Collaboration/Harshal_imgs_vids/L40/Nucleus_token.mp4?csf=1&web=1&e=7VFNOr) video by James Burton. To get to the screen seen at the beginning of the video, visit the [link](https://ovxnucleus.rcd.clemson.edu/omni/web3/). 

### Setting up Omnidev
The vnodoes (virtual nodes) already have the "omnidev" drive mapped. However, this drive needs to be mapped manually on a local workstation. Manual mapping is needed for easier file transfer. Omnidev is a volume where all the environments, robot URDF's and Reinforcement Learning libraries will be. To map this drive locally follow instructions given here for [linux](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/indigo/access_smb/instructions_linux/) or here for [windows](https://docs.rcd.clemson.edu/indigo/access_smb/instructions_windows/).

### Download Nvidia Omniverse Launcher
You will need NVIDIA Streaming Client which needs to be downloaded using NVIDIA Omniverse Client. Follow this [Link](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/omniverse/download/) to download NVIDIA Omniverse SDK. You will be greeted with following screen.

## Running Isaac ROS and Isaac Sim on L40
Once you have successfully setup omnitoken, uploaded required files in omnidev folder, and downloaded the Streaming Client you are in position run Isaac ROS and Isaac Sim on Palmetto Cluster with L40 GPU's.

### Login to Palmetto Node
First login to the Palmetto Cluster. (Note: You may not have access to the palmetto cluster by default. Please talk to your Supervisor/PI/Professor about getting the access.)
Open MobaXterm and click on "Session" tab on the upper left corner. Then Click on "SSH". Now type the following in the "Remote Host field" keeping everything else untouched and click OK. Here replace user with Clemson user ID. You will be prompted to enter your password. This password is the same one that you use to login into CANVAS/iRoar/HR portal etc. Then choose the dual authentication method of your choice: SMS passcode or Duo Push. After successful login, you should see "Welcome to the PALMETTO CLUSTER at CLEMSON UNIVERSITY" message in the terminal window.

                                                    `USER@login.palmetto.clemson.edu`
<p align="center">

</p>

### Login to Virtual Node
In the terminal, type: `ssh -Y vnode00X` where X goes from 1 to 7. Each number represents a different virtual node on Palmetto Cluster. Pick a number and stick with it throughout this documentation. This will log you on a virtual node, where we will be doing rest of the work.

</p>

We will need four different terminals each one logged into Palmetto and same vnode. As shown below, Right click on the current terminal tab and click on duplicate. Then follow the login procedure all over again 3 times.

### Load Omniverse assets from Clemson's nucleus server and Launch Isaac Sim
Assuming you have successfully managed to setup omnitoken, type the following command in the first terminal:- `source .omnitoken`  
Then to make sure you have successfully source the token, type - `env | grep OMNI`. This will show you the key/token.

</p>

You should see the outputs shown in the gif above. If you are successful, type the following in terminal- `launch-isaac-sim`   
This command will spin up a container and launch Nvidia Isaac Sim.

</p>

### Connect to Streaming Client
Once the isaac sim is ready and launched, you will see the message: "Isaac Sim Headless Native App is loaded" at the end of the terminal. When you see this message open up the Omniverse Launcher and start Streaming Client. If its already running, switch to that window.
